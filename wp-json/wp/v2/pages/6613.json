We&#8217;re not a big company, but everyone from staff and to management are so close knit that we consider ourselves family with one common goal; to give our customers the best possible service that we&#8217;ve maintained for years.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bodytext\">4 Seasons was opened by the previous ownership in 1991, building a trusted reputation with the community. In 2017, we changed over ownership and management eager to work with the long-time employees in continuing to give the excellent service the community has come to expect and rely on.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bodytext\">Our highly skilled and proficient technicians have spent years installing various lines of fireplaces, but were attracted to the charm and reliability of Regency products and decided that as of 2017, we would become Regency key dealers. Within the last two years, our dedication to the installation and servicing of Regency products has made us the #1 dealer on Vancouver Island.<\/p>\n<p class=\"bodytext\">Our technical skills go far beyond fireplaces, we are also one of three local dealers proudly installing and promoting Daikin products since 2015. From furnaces to heat pumps, Daikin products are highly efficient and have some of the best warranties on the market. This is because they stand behind the products they manufacture; knowing consumers who chose to install their products will always be more than satisfied with their purchase. We offer all of these quality products, backed by warranties as well as <a href=\"https:\/\/4seasonsvictoria.com\/rebates\/\" data-track-event=\"click\" data-track-action=\"internal_link_clicked\">rebates.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text]\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><div class=\"mkdf-eh-item   mkdf-horizontal-alignment-right \"  data-item-class=\"mkdf-eh-custom-1907\" data-1367-1600=\"0px 0px 0px 100px\" data-1025-1366=\"15px 0 0 0\" data-769-1024=\"15px 0 0 0\" data-681-768=\"15px 0 0 0\" data-680=\"15px 0 0 0\">\n\t<div class=\"mkdf-eh-item-inner\">\n\t\t<div class=\"mkdf-eh-item-content mkdf-eh-custom-1907\" style=\"padding: 0px 0px 0px 100px\">\n\t\t\t[vc_empty_space height=&#8221;35px&#8221;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;6618&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;35px&#8221;][vc_single_image image=&#8221;6617&#8243; img_size=&#8221;full&#8221;]\t\t<\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><\/div>[vc_row_inner][vc_column_inner][\/vc_column_inner][\/vc_row_inner][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n<\/div>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row row_btt_skin=&#8221;light&#8221; row_background_text_position=&#8221;front&#8221;][vc_column][rev_slider_vc alias=&#8221;about-us-slider&#8221; enable_paspartu=&#8221;no&#8221;][vc_empty_space height=&#8221;50px&#8221; el_id=&#8221;top-space&#8221;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row][vc_row row_btt_skin=&#8221;light&#8221; row_background_text_position=&#8221;front&#8221; el_class=&#8221;main-column&#8221;][vc_column][vc_column_text el_class=&#8221;text-mobile&#8221;] 4 Seasons is Greater Victoria\u2019s premiere choice for fireplaces, heat pumps, furnaces, hot water heaters and air conditioners.
